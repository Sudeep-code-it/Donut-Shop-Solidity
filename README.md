# Donut-Shop-Solidity

A simple contract to sell and buy donuts in exchange of ether.

1 donut price = 1 ether

The deployer of the cotract is set as the owner. Only he has the donuts(initially 100). Everybody can buy from him by paying required ethers. We can see how many numbers of 
donuts each person(or accounts) has. And only owner can add more stock of donuts.
